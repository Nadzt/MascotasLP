## Mascotas Perdidas La Plata

This is my first project, a full-stack app made with Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap for styling.

It's a portal to find pets that have been lost, by posting them into an interactive map.
Here are some of the features of the app:

    *Users can post a lost/found pet report, including a photo, description, and location.
    *Other users can view lost/found pet reports filter by location, breed, date, among others.
    *If a user finds a lost pet, they can contact the owner through the app.
    *User profiles by creating an user or Facebook OAuth.
    *Comment and Notification systems

Here are some screenshots of how the app used to look when deployed:
