## Mascotas Perdidas La Plata

This is my first project, a full-stack app made with Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap for styling. It used to be hosted on a Droplet on Digital Ocean, but it's no longer online. I'd like to recreate it with the knowledge I now possess, since I didn't like the Bootstrapy look, and it was the reason i took a CSS course to hone my skills.

It's a portal to find pets that have been lost, by posting them into an interactive map.
Here are some of the features of the app:

    Users can post a lost/found pet report, including a photo, description, and location and different filters(breed, sex, date, etc).
    Other users can view lost/found pet reports and search for pets by location and different filters(breed, sex, date, etc).
    If a user finds a lost pet, they can contact the owner through the app.
    User profiles by creating an user or Facebook OAuth.
    Comment and Notification systems

Here are some screenshots of how the app used to look when deployed:
